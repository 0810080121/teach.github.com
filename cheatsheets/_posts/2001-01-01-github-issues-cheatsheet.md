In addition to #<issue_number>, several other annotations can be used in a Git commit. For example, if you say fixes #<issue_number> in a commit message, the issue will be automatically closed when the commit is pushed back to GitHub.  Other synonyms include:

		fixes #xxx
		fixed #xxx
		fix #xxx
		closes #xxx
		close #xxx
		closed #xxx
