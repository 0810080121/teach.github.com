Git and GitHub Class Student Machine Prerequisites
============================================
This is the student requirement for preparing your account and laptop prior to class.  It will be best if you can escalate to administrative privileges for the tool installations. It is common for development tools to require administrative privileges at installation time.

A Free GitHub.com Account
----------------------------------------------------------
We'd like you to establish a GitHub account to facilitate hands-on practice of the network flow components of Git during class.  A free account can be established at:

<http://github.com/signup/free>

Please keep your username and password close at hand. You'll use it several times during class.

Common to all Operating Systems
----------------------------------------------------------
1. It would be best if Git were version _1.7.10_ or higher to match the behavior of the instructor's machine, but no actual repository incompatibilities will impact the class if the installed version is _1.7.x_ or newer.
2. Git's version can be queried by running `git --version` at the terminal or command prompt.

…and for _Windows_ Machines
----------------------------------------------------------
1. The preferred installation is from the Download button at:  
  <http://windows.github.com>
2. The less feature-ful but potentially non-admin rights requiring download is at:  
  <http://git-scm.com/download/win>

...and for _Mac OS X_ Machines
----------------------------------------------------------
1. Install the command line edition of Git from the package available at:  
  <http://git-scm.com/download/mac>
2. The location of the installed Git can be found with the command `which git`.
3. If `usr/bin/git`, it was likely installed by Apple or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
4. If `usr/local/bin/git` it was likely installed by [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).
5. `PATH` order may need to be modified to get the newly installed Git in "front" of other Git installations.

…and for _Linux_ Machines
----------------------------------------------------------
1. Git will likely already be installed. It is present in most modern Linux distributions.
2. Package managers such as _Synaptic_, `yum` and `apt-get` are the best way to install and update Git.
3. The Git source code can be obtained and compiled from the [Git mirror on GitHub](https://github.com/git/git).
