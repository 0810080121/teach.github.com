# WiFi for Demos
We may try to use a private network today (without port blocking or restrictions) to share code amongst ourselves. I've brought along a small WiFi device that can handle 30-50 people, but won't give us Internet access. That's alright though as we aren't going to use the 'net much.

Please ensure you can sign on to the following wireless network:

Wireless SSID:

    `<SOMESSID>`

Password:

    `<somepassword>`
    
Additionally, try to connect to my laptop (ping it), as I'll host some repos there. My notebook IP address is:

    10.X.X.X
