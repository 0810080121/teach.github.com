* As a reminder, any file in the `gh-pages` branch of your repository will be transparently served via GitHub Pages including CSS, HTML, images, javascript, etc.
* If you don't want a file or folder to be accessible via the web, simply start the filename with an underscore (`_`)
* Otherwise, all files are run through Jekyll by default
