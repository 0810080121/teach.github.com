* Jekyll uses a a simple format called [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) to organize file properties
* YAML (or YML front matter as it is also called) often lives at the top of a file surrounded by three `-` characters on the lines above and below
* At its most basic level, YAML is simply a set of properties and values separated by a colon (`:`), e.g.:

       ----
       title: Hello world!
       layout: page
       ----

* Any text-bassed file, regardless of the filetype can be given YML
* Jekyll will strip the YML front matter before serving the file via GitHub pages
* YML front matter can control the file's presentation and is available within the template (more to come)
