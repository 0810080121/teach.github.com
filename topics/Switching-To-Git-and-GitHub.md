# Switching to GitHub
Many companies ask why they should switch to Git and GitHub. The answer primarily lies in doing less repetitive work, and making your source code control efforts disppear into the background instead of be in the forefront of your workflow. Your [focus should be on your creative work](https://github.com/features/projects) and just incidentally have it versioned. As soon as your project is no longer a solo effort, you desire to have it support collaboration. In the space of version control, our users claim that no set of tools does that as well as Git and GitHub.

Additionally, a [growing constituency](https://github.com/blog/865-github-dominates-the-forges) of open source is hosted at GitHub. In June of 2011, GitHub had [more commits than Sourceforge, Google Code, and CodePlex combined](http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2011/06/github-has-passed-sourceforge.php).

## What are Git and GitHub?
A [set of videos](http://git-scm.com/videos) on the official Git site offer a basic C-Suite level review of the benefits of Git and GitHub.

Additional, there is an [About Git](http://git-scm.com/about) set of pages that explain the same ideas in text and digram form.
